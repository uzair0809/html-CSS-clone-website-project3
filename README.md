### Responsive Image and Text Layout Webpage

This project is a simple yet responsive webpage layout that includes a flexible navigation bar, horizontal scrollable sections for text and images, and a responsive design for mobile devices. It utilizes **HTML**, **CSS**, and external **Remix Icon** resources for styling and icons. 

#### Features:
- **Navigation Bar**: Two navigation bars are implemented: the top nav contains links and icons, while the second provides additional categories. 
- **Scrollable Text Section**: Displays multiple large headings in a horizontally scrollable format.
- **Image Section**: A section showcasing images that adapt to the screen size while maintaining quality and fit.
- **Responsive Design**: Includes media queries for mobile devices with a maximum width of 600px, ensuring a user-friendly experience on smaller screens.

#### Technologies Used:
- **HTML5** for structuring content.
- **CSS3** for layout, styling, and responsiveness.
- **Remix Icon** for using vector icons in the navigation bar.

#### How It Works:
1. **Text Content Section**: Text items are horizontally scrollable with a smooth scrolling effect. Custom scrollbar styling is applied.
2. **Image Content Section**: Images are displayed with full-width and height scaling, ensuring they fit well within the container.
3. **Responsive Adjustments**: The layout automatically adjusts for smaller screens, hiding unnecessary elements, enlarging icons, and scaling text and images accordingly.
